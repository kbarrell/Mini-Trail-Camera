# Mini-Trail-Camera

This repository holds the development of a mini trail camera intended for night-time detection and photographing of passing animals.  This project has been motivated by an interest in identifying the source of garden damage being caused by an unknown nocturnal visitor to a suburban residential block.  It follows the approach documented by Rui and Sara Santos at [RandomNerdTutorials](https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cam-pir-motion-detector-photo-capture/).

The completed camera unit is not intended for remote location deployment.  It incorporates a PIR motion sensor to wake the ESP32-CAM camera development board from sleep, trigger its flash and photograph the target animal - storing the image on the on-board microSD card for later offload.
